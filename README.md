# satellite_coverage_optimizer
Combinatorial optimization project addressing reactive Earth observation coverage with a 32-satellite LEO constellation. The system selects and schedules satellite passes (full or partial) to satisfy prioritized observation requests under strict time-window constraints, while minimizing total reservation cost.
